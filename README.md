## 🪄 Core Concepts: Metacognition in AI

Metacognition refers to thinking about thinking. In Neosgenesis, metacognition is implemented as a loop that is explicit and observable.

- Perception
  - The system collects input data and context.
  - It identifies uncertainties, constraints, and goals.

- Reflection
  - The system considers multiple strategies.
  - It weighs risks and benefits of different plans.

- Planning
  - It constructs a concrete action sequence.
  - It assigns decision criteria and success measures.

- Execution
  - It calls the selected tools in order.
  - It monitors results and handles errors.

- Evaluation
  - It checks whether outcomes meet goals.
  - It logs discrepancies and updates decision rules.

- Adaptation
  - It updates plans and tool selections based on feedback.
  - It learns what strategies work best for similar tasks.

This cycle is designed to be observable. Every step has a traceable record that helps you audit decisions or reproduce experiments.

---

## 🧭 System Interactions: How a Task Flows

A typical task in Neosgenesis follows a clear path from input to solution, with points where humans or automated agents can intervene.

- Input ingestion
  - You provide a problem statement, data, or a goal.
  - The system normalizes and validates the input.

- Problem understanding
  - The engine analyzes the task characteristics.
  - It identifies constraints, success criteria, and potential hazards.

- Planning phase
  - The system outlines a plan with steps, expected outcomes, and checkpoints.
  - It selects tools necessary for each step.

- Action execution
  - Tools are invoked in a controlled sequence.
  - Outputs from tools are captured and normalized for the next stage.

- Evaluation and iteration
  - The system checks results against criteria.
  - If goals are not met, it revises the plan and tries again.

- Output delivery
  - The final result is presented with reasoning summaries.
  - The system logs a traceable decision record.

This flow is designed to be robust to partial failures. The system can fallback to alternative strategies when certain tools do not return useful results.

---

## 🧰 Quick Reference: Tool Integration and Adapter Model

The tool integration layer is a core differentiator. It lets the system connect to a variety of external capabilities without rewriting core logic.

- Tool registry
  - A catalog of tools with metadata: name, version, capabilities, input schema, output schema.
  - CRUD operations to add, update, or remove tools.

- Adapters
  - Each tool has an adapter that translates the generic internal calls to the tool's interface.
  - Adapters standardize inputs and outputs to maintain consistent downstream processing.

- Invocation policy
  - Rules determine when to call which tool.
  - Policies can consider model confidence, data quality, and historical success rates.

- Result normalization
  - Outputs from tools are normalized to a common structure.
  - This makes it easier to feed results into the planning phase and evaluation.

- Tool safety
  - Each tool can have safety checks and limits.
  - Actions can be restricted to avoid unsafe or unwanted operations.

- Tool integration examples
  - Text processing and summarization services
  - Data retrieval from structured sources
  - Computation and analysis services
  - Visualization and reporting utilities
  - Human-in-the-loop approval steps

The design emphasizes decoupling. You can swap in new tools or replace adapters without touching the core engine.
